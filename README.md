## About
MoodTracker is a prototype iOS application that does a simple thing: Allow the user to register his mood based on a question and a set of answers.

The intention behind building this prototype is to practice using UIKit, URLSession and Core Data. There is a potential to include CoreML and Vision frameworks, as I want to practice writing applications using these frameworks as well.
